# components creating

- only use components from shadcn ui never create your own components from scratch. look in the `./src/components/` dir for components if you can find them then look online in shadcn library and install them

# building for testing

- only build and test if specified

# general work

- ask questions instead of choosing yourself when you have any confusion
